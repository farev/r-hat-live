# Final Fix: Tool Detection on Turn Completion

## The Problem

The AI was correctly outputting the tool call format:
```
"Sure! TOOL_CALL: highlight_object | OBJECT: headphones. I've highlighted the headphones for you."
```

But the tool wasn't executing because:

### Issue: Streaming Transcriptions
The AI's response arrives in **chunks** (word by word):
```
"Happy to"
" help!"
" TOOL_CALL:"
" highlight_object"
" | OBJECT:"
" headphones."
...
```

We were checking each chunk individually for the pattern, but the pattern only exists in the **complete** assembled transcription.

## The Solution

**Move tool detection to turn completion** instead of checking each chunk.

### What Changed:

**Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
// Handle output transcription (AI responding)
if (message.serverContent?.outputTranscription) {
    currentOutputTranscription += transcriptionText;

    // ❌ Checking incomplete chunks
    const highlightMatch = detectHighlightIntent(transcriptionText, currentOutputTranscription);
}
```

**After (WORKING):**
```typescript
// Handle output transcription (AI responding)
if (message.serverContent?.outputTranscription) {
    currentOutputTranscription += transcriptionText;
    // Just accumulate, don't check yet
}

// Handle turn completion
if (message.serverContent?.turnComplete) {
    // ✅ Now check the complete transcription
    const highlightMatch = detectHighlightIntent(currentOutputTranscription, currentOutputTranscription);
    if (highlightMatch) {
        // Execute tool!
    }
}
```

## Flow Diagram

```
User speaks: "highlight the headphones"
    ↓
AI starts responding (streaming):
    "Happy to" → accumulate
    " help!" → accumulate
    " TOOL_CALL:" → accumulate
    " highlight_object" → accumulate
    " | OBJECT:" → accumulate
    " headphones." → accumulate
    ...
    ↓
Turn complete! Full transcription:
    "Happy to help! TOOL_CALL: highlight_object | OBJECT: headphones. I've highlighted them for you."
    ↓
Pattern matching on complete text:
    ✓ Matched pipe format: "headphones"
    ↓
Create synthetic function call:
    { name: 'highlight_object', args: { object_name: 'headphones' } }
    ↓
Execute tool handler
    ↓
Capture frame, call backend (Phase 2), show overlay
```

## Expected Console Output

### During Streaming:
```
🎤 AI Response: Happy to
🎤 AI Response:  help!
🎤 AI Response:  TOOL_CALL:
🎤 AI Response:  highlight_object
🎤 AI Response:  | OBJECT:
🎤 AI Response:  headphones.
🎤 AI Response:  I've
🎤 AI Response:  highlighted
🎤 AI Response:  the headphones
🎤 AI Response:  for you.
```

### On Turn Complete:
```
🔍 DETECTED HIGHLIGHT INTENT: { objectName: 'headphones' }
✓ Matched pipe format: headphones
📞 Executing synthetic tool call: { name: 'highlight_object', id: 'synthetic_...', args: { object_name: 'headphones' } }
✅ Tool executed successfully: { ... }
```

### In UI:
- Transcription panel shows user message
- Transcription panel shows AI message
- System message: "Using highlight_object..."
- AI state changes to "Using Tool" (purple indicator)
- System message: "Highlighted headphones (mock - backend not connected yet)"
- Mock overlay appears on video feed

## Why Async Execution?

```typescript
(async () => {
    try {
        const response = await toolCallHandler(syntheticCall);
        // ...
    } catch (error) {
        // ...
    }
})();
```

We execute the tool in an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) so:
- Turn completion logic doesn't block
- Tool execution happens in parallel
- Errors are caught and handled gracefully
- AI state returns to listening after tool completes

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Empty transcription**: Check for `.trim()` before processing
2. **No tool match**: Return to listening normally
3. **Tool execution error**: Catch error, log it, return to listening
4. **Multiple tool calls in one response**: First match wins (future: could support multiple)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start session
- [ ] Say "highlight the headphones"
- [ ] AI responds with tool call format
- [ ] Console shows: chunks accumulating
- [ ] Console shows: turn complete
- [ ] Console shows: pattern match detected
- [ ] Console shows: tool executing
- [ ] Console shows: tool executed successfully
- [ ] UI shows: system messages about tool usage
- [ ] UI shows: AI state changes to "Using Tool"
- [ ] UI shows: mock overlay appears
- [ ] No errors in console

## Status

✅ Build successful
✅ Tool detection moved to turn completion
✅ Async tool execution implemented
✅ Error handling in place
✅ State management updated

**Ready to test - should work now!** 🎉

**Key Insight**: When working with streaming text, always wait for the complete message before pattern matching!
